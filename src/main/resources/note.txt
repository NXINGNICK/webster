You’ll need to modify several areas in order to implement the email verification flow as you’ve described. Below is a high-level to-do list, identifying which files to update and why:

I just want everything functional
So let's edit all of em
DatabaseHelper.java
admin.html
content-manager.js
WebsterPlugin.java
and APIRouteHandler.java

let's start with the WebsterPlugin.java
don't remove other features. Generate me a new WebsterPlugin.java
WebsterPlugin.java (or possibly APIRouteHandler.java, depending on where you keep your HTTP routes)
• Add a new endpoint (e.g., /auth/verify) that:
– Extracts the verification token from the URL (or query parameters).
– Looks up the user in the DB by the token.
– If matched/successful, updates that user’s account to a “verified” status, then returns success or redirects to “verification-success.html.”
– If unmatched, returns an error or redirects the user to re-login.
• During registration, generate a unique verification token (a random string) and store it in the DB.
• Modify the email body so it contains the verification link, e.g. “http://yoursite.com/auth/verify?token=XYZ.”
DatabaseHelper.java
• Add or update your user_accounts table to have a “verification_token” column (plus possibly a “verified” boolean column).
• Implement a method like storeVerificationToken(email, token) to save the token to that user in the DB.
• Implement a method like verifyAccountByToken(token) that checks if the token is valid, updates the user’s verified status, and possibly returns the user’s info.
script.js
• After the user registers, redirect them to “verify-email.html.”
• Potentially handle the token logic after the user visits the “verification-success.html,” though you may also let the server handle most of the logic (the user just clicks the emailed link).
• If you want to store the token locally (e.g., localStorage), do it when the server returns it in the verification step (or from the success route).
verify-email.html
• This page is mostly a static “Please check your email” message. Just be sure it aligns with your script.js logic if you want any dynamic feedback.
verification-success.html
• Create or revise this page to pull the token from the URL or from the server’s success response, then store it locally if you wish. If you prefer the server does all the heavy lifting, this page can be static except for a script that reads the returned token.
• You might also show a success message or automatically redirect the user to a login page.
config.yml (optional)
• If you want to customize the subject/body of your verification emails, add an “emailTemplates.verification” block, or store the verification link pattern in the config.
Follow-up questions you might clarify before coding:

• What route do you want for verifying the token? (e.g., /auth/verify?token=XYZ)
• How do you prefer to store the user’s “verified” state in the database? (boolean column, or store the token and check if it’s empty, etc.)
• Should the user still be able to log in if not verified, or does the plugin block them until verified?

Let me know if you have additional details about any of those points, and we can refine the plan accordingly.
